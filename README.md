# COVID-19

In a fast-evolving pandemic it is not a simple matter to identify the countries that are most successful in making progress against it. 

I have written scripts that will model the progression over time in regards to these topics:
  1. Cases
  2. Deaths
  3. Vaccinations
  4. Testing
  
  
  This is data from January 2020 to March 2021. 
  
  This shows us that the rate of COVID-19 cases and deaths have decreased and the vaccination and testing rates have increased over time.
